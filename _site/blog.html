      <p>When it comes to building commander decks, I lean toward the esoteric. I think of each deck concept as a puzzle and each game as an opportunity to show off a hard-won solution. With this project, I wanted to deconstruct the very concept of a deck a little---what if a deck could actually be ten decks?</p>
<p>I played bit of the Jumpstart product, in which two packs from a list of different themes are shuffled together to form a ready-to-play 40 card deck. I slowly worked through a box of Jumpstart 2024 with one of my former students over the course of a few weeks, and I was impressed by the replayability. In particular, how playing the same pack twice paired with different themes created very different experiences.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Inspired by Jumpstart, this project consists of a set half-decks, each helmed by a partner commander. One must be able to take any two of these half decks, shuffle them together, and have a functional commander deck.</p>
<h2 id="some-considerations-and-constraints">Some Considerations and Constraints</h2>
<p>One consideration has to do with logistic: the decks must be separable back into its two halves.  Another concerns scope: the more half-decks in the set, the more complicated the interactions between them are. In light of these two considerations, I settled on five mono-color half-decks. My options for partners are then covered by the following Scryfall query.
