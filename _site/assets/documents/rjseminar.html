    <h2>Racial Justice Seminar Resources</h2>
    <div id="content" class="full">
        In 2020-2021 I co-organized a racial justice seminar for the Dartmouth math department. We met periodically over Zoom to discuss readings. This page summarizes the resources that Carolyn Gordon and I prepared for the seminar.

<h3>Discussion Guidelines</h3>

We formed the following guidelines for discussion as a group at the first session. Some guidelines were added or revised at subsequent sessions.

	<ol>
		<li>"I" statements.</li>
		<li>Moderator will call on people in order if more than one person tries to speak at once.</li>
		<li>Abandon rank.   Treat all as peers.  Hear ideas, not authority.</li>
		<li>"Principle of Charity": Try to ascribe to each other the best possible intention.</li>
		<li>Avoid inflammatory/antagonistic language.</li>
		<li>Respectful anonymity.   Avoid naming.</li>
		<li>Specifics are private to the group, but lessons can be shared.</li>
		<li>Step up and step back.   (Make sure everyone has an opportunity to speak.)</li>
		<li>"Call in, not out":  When someone says something that makes you uncomfortable, express your discomfort and invite them to say more.</li>
		<li>Allow yourself to step back and take a moment before responding.</li>
		<li>Express without trying to convince.</li>
		<li>Don't pressure anyone to share more than they might be comfortable sharing.</li>
	</ol>
